As featured [in this blog post](http://goold.me/blog/hacking-the-mcdonalds-monopoly).

A small app I made to imitate the 2017 McDonald's Monopoly app and allow the user to select whichever prize they want.

# Installation

Clone the repo and then build with your favourite APK compiler. An APK is included by default too.

# Notes

* The app should start but probably will need tweaking if you want it to scale on a modern phone.
* Don't try and claim free food from McDonald's with this, it won't work anymore since the Monopoly game changes every year.
